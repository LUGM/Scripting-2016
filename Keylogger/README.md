## Installation

Since pyxhook and Xlib both are not avaiable anymore via pip, the procedure is as follows:

* Download the required package from https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/releases
* Extract and run sudo python setup.py build && python setup.py install
* Download pyxhook from https://github.com/JeffHoogland/pyxhook and copy it in the directory your file is present in.
* Run the script normally!
